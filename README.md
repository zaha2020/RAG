# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for PDF Documents

## Decription:

This miniproject is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system focused on Persian language text processing. It combines text extraction, text embedding, and natural language generation to answer questions and retrieve relevant information from Persian PDF documents. The core language model used is jtatman/orca-tau-4k-persian-alpaca-f32, which has been optimized for Persian, allowing accurate and contextually relevant responses.
